# Digital-Image-Processing-Basic-Operations-on-Image

I worked on some basic operations on image using OpenCV. 

This repository contains -
1. converting an image into gray scale
2. converting an image into binary format (global thresholding as well as OSTU thresholding)
3. histogram of an image
4. various filters on image - average filter, mean filter, median filter, max filter, gaussian filter
5. logarithmic, power law transformation on image
6. morphological operations - erosion, dilation, opening, closing, Skeletonization, boundary of image
7. Laplacian mask, sobel mask, Prewitt mask, Canny edge detection
